# CaveStory Save Editor
A CLI save editor for the 2004 indie cult-classic CaveStory.

## Requirements
All you need is the [Mono runtime](https://mono-project.com) since this was programmed in C# with MonoDevelop and thanks to this, you can run this program on any OS that Mono supports.

## Using
First, you need to drag your Profile.dat file to the same directory as the editor (or vise versa). Once you've done that open the program. Right now, your only options
are viewing data, editing your current and max hp, and change the current song that is playing. Once your done, bring the Profile.dat back to the CaveStory directory.  
Please note that this only works for the original 2004 release of CaveStory.

## TODO:
* Create ammo and max ammo editor
* Create level and XP editors
* Create inventory editor
* Create event flag editor
* Allow users to edit song by writing in song name
* Allow user to edit any Profile.dat file

## Notes
Apparently [setting HP to a high value causes strange behaviors](https://www.cavestory.org/guides/profile.txt). I say don't set it any higher than the maxium HP you can
legitimately get in game (42).
